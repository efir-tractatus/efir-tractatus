### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for coming to my GitHub space! No, that's not me in the photo, it's just a picture of a mushroom I took in [Oregon Ridge Park](https://goo.gl/maps/2w1Wmcu6skZF3ogE6), make sure to go if you are in the neighbourhood it's a great hike.
Did you know that mushrooms are just the fruiting bodies of a much larger organism called mycelium. Fascinating topic, but I digress...

Pinned below you will find links to my most significant public projects on GitHub.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the front end aspect of [efir.space](https://github.com/efir-tractatus/efir.space) which is being built with React & jQuery

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning graph theory and it's diverse implementations as well as how it ties into the blockchain (Etherium in particular)

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on bug squshing and back end development. I enjoy working with Express.js & Apollo Server, building RESTful or GraphQL APIs connecting to Postgresql or MongoDB datastores
