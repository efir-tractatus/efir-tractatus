### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for coming to my GitHub space! No that's not me in the photo, it's just a picture of a mushroom I took in [Oregon Ridge Park](https://goo.gl/maps/2w1Wmcu6skZF3ogE6), make sure to go if you are in the neighbourhood it's a great hike.
Did you know that mushrooms are just the fruiting bodies of a much larger organism called mycelium. Just like that lonely mushroom you see in the picture, this profile serves to give you a general overview of my skills as a Software Developer. The depths of which can be found with further exploration.

Below you will find my most significant public projects.
